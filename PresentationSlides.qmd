# Background and Introduction

## Graphical Modeling

\note{
 Gozde:
 
 Undirected graphical models enables to model multivariate distributions. Suppose we observe a $p$-dimensional sample $x = (x_1, \dots , x_p)$ from a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a non-singular covariance matrix. Then the conditional independence structure of the distribution can be represented with a graph $G$. The graph $G = (V, E)$ is characterized by a node set $V = (1, \dots, p)$ corresponding to the $p$ variables, and an edge set $E$ such that $(i,j)\in E$ if and only if $x_i$ and $x_j$ are conditionally dependent given all other variable. The goal is to estimate the underlying graph $G$ from given $n$ idd observations $x_1, \dots , x_p$.

## The False Positive Problem

\note{
 Gozde
}

 - This model demonstrates superior sensitivity than competing methods
 - It suffers from lower specificity 
    - Compared with competing methods from the `mgm` [@mgm] and `JGL` [@JGL]packages, specificity gets substantially worse with $p$. 
 - For gene expression data, this could lead to worse outcomes than a less sensitive and more specific model
    - The cost of carrying out experiments which show a lack of a predicted relation may be very expensive    - We want to **increase the specificity of the model without substantially hurting the model's sensitivity and speed**.
